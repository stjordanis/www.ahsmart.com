## My Book

\image{Hands-on Design Patterns and Best Practices with Julia}{/assets/pages/design_patterns_book/bookcover_400px.jpg}{img-left}

**I am the author** of the book [Hands-on Design Patterns and Best Practices with Julia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/183864881X) published by Packt Publishing in January 2020.

**This is my first book**, and I have spent months of my weekend time to do the research and write about various patterns pioneered by other expert Julia programmers.  I also feel honored to have [Stefan Karpinski](https://karpinski.org/) writing forewords for the book.

**From the preface**:
This book fulfills several demands from Julia developers:
*A desire to write better code.
A desire to improve system performance.
A desire to design software that is easy to maintain.*

## My Mobile Apps

I developed several iOS apps during 2012-2015.  Here are the ones still on-the-shelf:

- [My Graphics](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-graphics/id534963449) is a drawing program that generate images based upon spiral and fractal patterns. It is written in Objective-C and Scheme ([SCM/SLIB](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/SCM.html)).

- [HealthyWalk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/healthywalk/id782944633) is a pedometer app with a simple and clean user interface.  It is written in Objective-C.
