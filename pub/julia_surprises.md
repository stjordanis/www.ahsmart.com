\blogtitle{Surprises for new Julia users}
\blogdate{Jan 5, 2020}

When I first learned about the Julia language, I came across several things that seem counter-intuitive given my prior programming experience.  Perhaps it is to be a hump that every new Julia user needs to get over.  In this post, we will look into some of
the most common questions that people often raise.

Learn
- Why does it take time to load packages
- How to discover methods with IDE's help?

Book
- What is name conflict and how to avoid unexpected problems?
- Functions are first class but not really typed by arguments/return type.

Discourse
- Mutable structs are never stored in contiguous block of memory.
